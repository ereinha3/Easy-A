Meeting: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:45pm to 5:30pm.
Additional times to be specified as needed.

Record of Meetings:

Jan 11th from 3:00pm to 3:20pm (in class).
Exchanged contact information, scheduled future meetings.
Decided to use an incremental approach to development, and that multiple programming languages could be used for the project. For example, that a Python library could be used for the webscraper, which would be used to generate a new data file. Since the graphics and UI code executing from a data file need not have information about how that data was gathered, it could be written in a different language (for example C++) with no consequences. The exact languages to use for what components required further research by the team.

Jan 11th from 4:00pm to 4:30pm (Morgan and Ethan).
Morgan and Ethan met to test the setup of the group github repository.

Jan 15th from 11:00am to 11:50am.
Met as a group to discuss deliverables for the upcoming week, and to establish roles for the project. As a result of our meeting:

Python was decided upon as the core language to use throughout the project due to its powerful libraries for data manipulation and graphing.
Andrew has taken responsibility for matplotlib.
Ethan and Darby have taken responsibility for creating the UI in tkinter.
Alex has taken responbility for the webscraper.
Morgan has taken responsiblity for creating the initial data file, for documenting administrative setup, and for creating diagrams for the software architecture.
All engineers involved will help each other throughout the project, nowone will work alone.
Darby Wright set up an SDS over google docs for the group to edit.
